**Intructions**

The file ReadVideoData.m contains the MATLAB code to read the algorithm to read the skeletons from videos and automatically detect the hip, knee, ankle, heel and metatarsal points of the skeletons while cycling.

In order to run it properly, first, you need to follow these steps:

1. Include the folder *MEX_file* in your MATLAB path.
2. Include all the files of this shared folder https://www.dropbox.com/sh/dxturx00xsxsjr5/AADcssOkZW7T0WwT2esof5d2a?dl=0 to the *MEX_file* folder.

We tested the files in Windows 10, Matlab versions R2016a and R2019b (x64). We cannot ensure that work in other versions of MATLAB. The MEX file will not work in other OS.
